    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in British-ruled India. He hailed from a devout Hindu family and was greatly influenced by his mother's teachings of compassion and non-violence. As a young man, Gandhi studied law in London and later worked as a lawyer in South Africa, where he first encountered racial discrimination, sparking his commitment to social justice.</p>

    <h2>The Transformation</h2>
    <p>Gandhi's return to India in 1915 marked the beginning of his active involvement in the Indian independence movement. He soon became a prominent leader, advocating non-violent civil disobedience as a means to challenge British colonial rule. His philosophy, rooted in the principle of "Ahimsa" or non-violence, aimed to unite people across India's diverse communities in the struggle for freedom.</p>

    <h2>The Salt March and Civil Disobedience</h2>
    <p>One of Gandhi's most iconic actions was the Salt March in 1930. In protest of the British monopoly on salt production and taxation, he led a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he famously collected salt from the shores. This act of civil disobedience inspired millions and drew global attention to India's plight.</p>

    <h2>Legacy of Peace and Non-Violence</h2>
    <p>Throughout his life, Gandhi faced imprisonment and personal sacrifices for his principles. His relentless commitment to non-violence and equality played a pivotal role in India's eventual independence in 1947. Despite the turmoil of the time, Gandhi's insistence on peaceful negotiation and reconciliation left a lasting legacy of peace and non-violence that has influenced civil rights movements and leaders worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Assassination and Eternal Influence</h2>
    <p>Tragically, on January 30, 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with his views on religious harmony. However, Gandhi's ideas and values continue to inspire individuals and movements dedicated to social justice, civil rights, and non-violent protest around the world. His legacy as the "Father of the Nation" in India and a global symbol of peace endures, reminding us of the power of compassion and non-violence in the face of adversity.</p>
